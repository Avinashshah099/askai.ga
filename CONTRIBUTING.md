## Correcting PRs
Rebasing PRs is preferred over merging master into the source branches again and again cluttering our history. If a reviewer has suggestions, the commit shall be amended so the history is not cluttered by "fixup commits".

## Writing Good Commits
Please see https://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Good_Commits.html for guidelines on how to write good commits and proper commit messages.
